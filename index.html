          <h1>Important Note</h1>
          <p>
            I made this Quiz Mine Website for students of Matric and FSc in
            which they can practice their MCQs for their exams preparation. This
            was a full MERN Stack project. Backend work was done by my
            instructor and I completed the front end tasks like routing,
            integrating APIs, checking mcqs, displaying results in form of
            charts and responsiveness of website. This was my Senior Phase
            Project at TopCamP I-8 Islamabad.

            Few days ago, when I started making my resume, I decided to put this
            project in my resume but this was not working because my instructor
            had to shut down his AWS account due to financial issue. I request
            him to create another account but he replied that during Ramzan,
            routine is very hectic, I will do it after Eid for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, I make this project again and put some MCQs in front end just to display you
            what I have built. All data is placed at front-end and hard coded. I
            hope you will understand my situation and give preference to my
            front end skills. Links are given below.
